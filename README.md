# Gyroscope_Sensor_Analysis

Dataset - https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00240/
This was done as a part of coursework for "Probabilistic Deep Learning with tensorflow 2.0"
The data consists of the readings from an accelerometer (which measures acceleration) carried by a human doing different activities. The six activities are walking horizontally, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing and laying down. The accelerometer is inside a smartphone, and, every 0.02 seconds (50 times per second), it takes six readings: linear and gyroscopic acceleration in the x, y and z directions. We want to build a model to predict the activity from the accelerometer data.
